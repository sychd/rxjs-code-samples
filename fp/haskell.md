Haskell notes:

Functions in Haskell don't have to be in any particular order, so it doesn't matter if you define doubleMe first and then doubleUs or if you do it the other way around.

The first is that in the function name we didn't capitalize Conan's name. That's because functions can't begin with uppercase letters. We'll see why a bit later. The second thing is that this function doesn't take any parameters.

When a function doesn't take any parameters, we usually say it's a definition (or a name).

In Haskell, lists are a homogenous data structure. It stores several elements of the same type.
